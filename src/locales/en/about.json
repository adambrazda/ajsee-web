      "p3": "Then came the hardest part: <strong>to actually start.</strong>",
      "p4": "We both had full-time jobs, lived <strong>180 kilometers</strong> apart, and time was short. The project stalled before it could even get going.",
      "p5": "Until one day, one of us <strong>just launched it</strong>. Without a perfect plan, but with the certainty that it made sense. And thatâ€™s when AJSEE started becoming real."
